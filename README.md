Prestashop XML Stock Update

Since presta 1.7 there is no advanced stock option.  You need to manage stocks externally in your "erp" system

This is a module that accepts as input XML file from external source.

As is configured now can be updated with xml file generated by SAGA software. 

Module was originaly developed by Dmitriy Ivanov

Some specific changes where applied on xml parsing. 


I am planning some improvements : 
- to export product codes that are not existent in SAGA but where used / sold on presta .
- eventually autodefine new products exported from SAGA -> prestashop and those are not defined in prestashop
